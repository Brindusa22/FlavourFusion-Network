# FlavourFusion Network

[FlavourFusion Network](https://flavour-fusion-network-a327ff165da1.herokuapp.com/) is designed as an international culinary community that provides a platform for users to submit their favorite recipes,
which are then shared with the community for others to try and review. It is a pace where food brings people together, regardless of their 
background and location.

The live version of this project can be found [here](https://flavour-fusion-network-a327ff165da1.herokuapp.com/).

## How to use - Existing features

- The recipes are groupped by 3 categories: by mealtype, cuisine and author.
On the Homepage the user has two options: he can access the recipes groupped by mealtype or can use the searchbar. The search method is by the recipe name or any character contained by the recipe name. The results are displayed below the searchbar as clickable recipe cards.
- The Recipe page contains all the categories of recipes including the list of all recipes. The filter is represented by 4 clickable buttons that redirect the user to the respective section. When clicked, each category opens in a new page.
- Each recipe can be viewd in detail on a separate page. It containes detailed information about the recipe such as a short description a main picture and a recipe detail card with ingredients, that can be checked, instructions, total time, servings, ratings preview and a small image.
